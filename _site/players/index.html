            <div class="prose prose-lg text-gray-light">
              <p>Chauncey lived in a one-room, run-down shack on the outskirts of Waterdeep with his</p>
<p>mother, Rebolly McEnparton and twin brother, Phauncey. The family had no money for food or</p>
<p>rent but they were naturally gifted musicians and performers. So the summer they turned 18,</p>
<p>Rebolly spent every last copper they had to buy them fabulous cloaks—Chauncey, a cloak of</p>
<p>many colors and Phauncey, a red satin cloak with red velvet trim. She sent them out to find</p>
<p>fortune as entertainers.</p>
<p>In their double act, it became very clear that Phauncey was the true talent and star,</p>
<p>gaining acclaim and riches. Chauncey was overcome with jealousy and one night recited these</p>
<p>words, “I can bear in no longer! Goblin King! Goblin King! Wherever you may be, take this</p>
<p>brother of mine far away from me!” The next morning, his brother was gone and Chauncey</p>
<p>witnessed the first sign of his Bardic skills. He returned home to deliver the news to his mother.</p>
<p>She was filled with sorrow and quickly became ill. With her dying breath, she made Chauncey</p>
<p>promise to find his brother. She gave him an ancient looking heart shaped locket. Its inscription</p>
<p>read “To thine own self be true”. Her last words being, “Here’s your one chance, Chauncey.</p>
<p>Don’t let me down.”</p>
<p>Chauncey was able to, with the aid of a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker, find the</p>
<p>location of the Goblin King. Chauncey attempted to infiltrate the court and win favor with TGK</p>
<p>but his charisma was found lacking. TGK told him that Phauncey was already dead (though his</p>
<p>body was never seen). He had Chauncey beaten before leaving the realm.</p>
<p>Nearly dead, Chauncey was found and rescued by a talented goblin bard, named Lizard.</p>
<p>She healed his wounds, rehabilitated him, and taught him to speak Goblin. She also agreed to</p>
<p>be his bard mentor and to teach him the magical arts of self-belief, panflute, and twerking.</p>
<p>Now, Chauncey is on a quest to become more powerful and skilled to one day face the Goblin</p>
<p>King and get his revenge.</p>
