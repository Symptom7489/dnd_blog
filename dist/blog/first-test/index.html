      <p>Today's session started with a surprise goblin ambush on the road to the city of Oakhaven. Our heroes, <strong>Arion the Bard</strong> and <strong>Evelyn the Paladin</strong>, were caught off guard but fought valiantly.</p>
<p>The session highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arion's clever use of a magical illusion to distract the goblins.</li>
<li>Evelyn's heroic charge, which saved a merchant's cart.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a great start to our new adventure!</p>
