The party finally left the capital and journeyed toward Oakhaven. After a brief, quiet rest, they encountered the strange landmark known as the **Bleeding Stone** The atmosphere felt very wrong, and a cold mist rolled in quickly.

They were immediately ambushed by two chilling **Shadow Wraiths** The encounter was incredibly dangerous, and **Bardin** the Cleric took significant damage before recovering. The party managed to rally and fend off the threat just as dawn broke.

The creatures vanished, leaving behind only a fragment of black obsidian. The party decided to make a hasty retreat and push onward to the nearest safe town to recover their strength.
