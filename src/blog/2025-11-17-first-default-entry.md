The party finally met at the **Worn Traveler Tavern** in the village of Oakhaven. After a brief scuffle over a lost goat, they agreed to escort Elara's caravan to the capital.

### The Ambush

We didn't travel far before we were ambushed by a band of **goblins**.

* Elara's cart was overturned.
* Bardin the cleric took a nasty blow to the head.
* The wizard used a stunning display of **Magic Missile** to end the threat.

We ended the session making camp, with the immediate road ahead looking clear. They recovered the following items:
* A rusty dagger
* **35 Gold Pieces**
* One slightly damaged goat.
