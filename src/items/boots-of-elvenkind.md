**Description**

These soft leather boots are often worn and well-cared for, bearing no distinguishing marks except for a faint, silver thread stitched into the sole. They never scuff or show signs of wear, regardless of the terrain traveled.

**Properties**

While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You have *advantage* on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently. These boots are particularly favored by rogues and rangers.
