**Description**

This is a massive broom made from rough birch and bound with human hair. It smells faintly of soot and chicken legs. It feels strangely unbalanced when held but has an irresistible pull toward distant forests.
 **Properties**

This broom is a legendary artifact. While attuned, it acts as a *Broom of Flying*, granting a flying speed of 50 feet. Additionally, once per day, you may use an action to command the broom to cast *Tasha's Hideous Laughter* (Save DC 16) by flicking dust into the target's face. The user is also immune to the effects of *grease* and *mud* spells while wielding it.
