title: Bramble (L)
---
Once known as WifflePiffle, the person now called Bramble is a walking embodiment of the wild, a transformation born from a mysterious journey into Limbo. Upon returning from that chaotic plane, their connection to the wild became unnervingly literal as vines began to sprout from their skin, weaving themselves into a living garment. But as this wild magic grew, Bramble's own past withered away; memories of his childhood and the reason he lived with his Fey hosts faded into an unnerving haze. Suspicion curdled into a grudge against the Fey, and as his anger festered, his magic grew increasingly volatile. This turmoil culminated in a hazy, tragic night where, after a foraged dinner, Bramble's next memory was of fleeing their home, leaving the Fae hosts dead in her wakeâ€”whether by accidental poison or an uncontrollable surge of magic, she cannot say.

Now a wanderer, Bramble drifts from town to town, an untethered soul haunted by the gaping holes in their own history. He presents a flat, almost emotionless demeanor, finding little use for the feelings of others unless it serves his purpose. They have learned to feign empathy with precision, coaxing stories from strangers not out of connection, but out of a desperate hunger for knowledge. To Bramble, every story is a potential clue, a piece of a world they no longer understand that might lead back to their own forgotten past. Joining a new company of adventurers is simply the next logical step in this manipulative quest for answers.
