title: Grom the Gorgeous (Mike)
---
Grom hatched beneath the gnarled roots of a mangrove in the Sword Coast Marshes, south of Neverwinter. His tortle clan, known as the Shellkeepers, were nomadic mystics who revered the cycles of nature and the flow of time itself. Unlike most tortles who spent their lives seeking new experiences, Grom was different — he was born obsessed with the past.

As a hatchling, he stumbled upon a half-sunken ruin. Inside was a moss-covered tome humming with arcane power. It called to him. He taught himself the basics of wizardry, learning to shape reality through runes, gestures, and sheer will. The book spoke of Leylines of Power, hidden throughout Faerûn, and the magic of those who came before.

At the age of 15, Grom traveled north to Neverwinter, drawn by its rich magical history and the bustling halls of wizardly learning. He sought mentors, ancient texts, and clues to a forgotten age, hoping to unlock secrets buried beneath centuries of mud.
