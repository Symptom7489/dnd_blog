title: Chauncy Heartstring (Philip)
---
Chauncey lived in a one-room, run-down shack on the outskirts of Waterdeep with his

mother, Rebolly McEnparton and twin brother, Phauncey. The family had no money for food or

rent but they were naturally gifted musicians and performers. So the summer they turned 18,

Rebolly spent every last copper they had to buy them fabulous cloaks—Chauncey, a cloak of

many colors and Phauncey, a red satin cloak with red velvet trim. She sent them out to find

fortune as entertainers.

In their double act, it became very clear that Phauncey was the true talent and star,

gaining acclaim and riches. Chauncey was overcome with jealousy and one night recited these

words, “I can bear in no longer! Goblin King! Goblin King! Wherever you may be, take this

brother of mine far away from me!” The next morning, his brother was gone and Chauncey

witnessed the first sign of his Bardic skills. He returned home to deliver the news to his mother.

She was filled with sorrow and quickly became ill. With her dying breath, she made Chauncey

promise to find his brother. She gave him an ancient looking heart shaped locket. Its inscription

read “To thine own self be true”. Her last words being, “Here’s your one chance, Chauncey.

Don’t let me down.”

Chauncey was able to, with the aid of a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker, find the

location of the Goblin King. Chauncey attempted to infiltrate the court and win favor with TGK

but his charisma was found lacking. TGK told him that Phauncey was already dead (though his

body was never seen). He had Chauncey beaten before leaving the realm.

Nearly dead, Chauncey was found and rescued by a talented goblin bard, named Lizard.

She healed his wounds, rehabilitated him, and taught him to speak Goblin. She also agreed to

be his bard mentor and to teach him the magical arts of self-belief, panflute, and twerking.

Now, Chauncey is on a quest to become more powerful and skilled to one day face the Goblin

King and get his revenge.
